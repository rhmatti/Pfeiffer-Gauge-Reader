# Pfeiffer-Gauge-Reader
Python code for reading and logging of pressure values from Pfeiffer TPG gauge controllers via a serial connection. This code was specifically written for use with a Pfeiffer TPG 361 gauge controller using the USB-B connection and serial commands. However, it should in theory work for the majority of Pfeiffer gauge controllers with serial outputs.
